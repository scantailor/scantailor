                     Base Random Number Generator



I. OVERVIEW AND DEFAULT BEHAVIOR

This   set of programs contains   32 virtual random number generators.
Each generator can provide 1,048,576 blocks of numbers, and each block
is of length 1,073,741,824.  Any generator can be set to the beginning
or end of the current block or to its starting value.  The methods are
from the paper  cited  immediately below, and  most of the  code  is a
transliteration from the Pascal of the paper into Fortran.

P.  L'Ecuyer and S. Cote.   Implementing a Random  Number Package with
Splitting Facilities.  ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software 17:1,
pp 98-111.

Most users won't need the sophisticated  capabilities of this package,
and will desire a single generator.  This single generator (which will
have a non-repeating length  of 2.3 X  10^18 numbers) is the  default.
In order to accommodate this use, the concept of the current generator
is added to those of the  cited paper;  references to a  generator are
always to the current generator.  The  current generator  is initially
generator number  1; it  can  be  changed by   setcgn, and the ordinal
number of the current generator can be obtained from getcgn.

The user of the default can set the  initial values of the two integer
seeds with setall.   If the user does  not set the   seeds, the random
number   generation will  use   the  default   values, 1234567890  and
123456789.  The values of the current seeds can be  achieved by a call
to GETSD.  Random number may be obtained as integers ranging from 1 to
a large integer by reference to function ignlgi or as a floating point
number between 0 and 1 by a reference to function ranf.  These are the
only routines  needed by a user desiring   a single stream   of random
numbers.

II. CONCEPTS

A stream of pseudo-random numbers is a sequence, each member  of which
can be obtained either as an integer in  the range 1..2,147,483,563 or
as a floating point number in the range [0..1].  The user is in charge
of which representation is desired.

The method contains an algorithm  for generating a  stream with a very
long period, 2.3 X 10^18.   This  stream  in  partitioned into G (=32)
virtual generators.  Each virtual generator contains 2^20 (=1,048,576)
blocks   of non-overlapping   random  numbers.   Each  block is   2^30
(=1,073,741,824) in length.



Base Random Number Generator Page 2


The state of a generator  is determined by two  integers called seeds.
The seeds can be  initialized  by the  user; the initial values of the
first must lie between 1 and 2,147,483,562, that of the second between
1 and 2,147,483,398.  Each time a number is generated,  the  values of
the seeds  change.   Three  values   of seeds are remembered   by  the
generators  at all times:  the   value with  which the  generator  was
initialized, the value at the beginning of the current block,  and the
value at the beginning of the next block.   The seeds of any generator
can be set to any of these three values at any time.

Of the  32 virtual   generators, exactly one    will  be  the  current
generator, i.e., that one will  be used to  generate values for ignlgi
and randf.   Initially, the current generator is   set to number  one.
The current generator may be changed by calling setcgn, and the number
of the current generator can be obtained using getcgn.

III. AN EXAMPLE

An example of  the  need  for these capabilities   is as follows.  Two
statistical techniques are being compared on  data of different sizes.
The first  technique uses   bootstrapping  and is  thought to   be  as
accurate using less data   than the second method  which  employs only
brute force.

For the first method, a data set of size uniformly distributed between
25 and 50 will be generated.  Then the data set  of the specified size
will be generated and alalyzed.  The second method will  choose a data
set size between 100 and 200, generate the data  and alalyze it.  This
process will be repeated 1000 times.

For  variance reduction, we  want the  random numbers  used in the two
methods to be the  same for each of  the 1000 comparisons.  But method
two will  use more random  numbers than   method one and  without this
package, synchronization might be difficult.

With the package, it is a snap.  Use generator 1 to obtain  the sample
size for  method one and generator 2  to obtain the  data.  Then reset
the state to the beginning  of the current  block and do the same  for
the second method.  This assures that the initial data  for method two
is that used by  method  one.  When both  have concluded,  advance the
block for both generators.

IV.  THE INTERFACE

A random number is obtained either  as a random  integer between 1 and
2,147,483,562  by invoking integer  function  ignlgi (I GeNerate LarGe
Integer)  or as a  random  floating point  number  between 0 and 1  by
invoking real function RANF.  Neither function has arguments.

The  seed of the  first generator  can  be set by invoking  subroutine
SETALL;   the values of   the seeds  of   the other 31 generators  are
calculated from this value.



Base Random Number Generator Page 3


The number of  the current generator  can be set by calling subroutine
SETCGN, which takes a single argument, the integer generator number in
the range 1..32.  The number of the current  generator can be obtained
by invoking subroutine getcgn  which returns the number  in its single
integer argument.
