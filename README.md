Scan Tailor
===========

Scan Tailor is an interactive post-processing tool for scanned pages.
It performs operations such as page splitting, deskewing, adding/removing borders, and others.
You give it raw scans, and you get pages ready to be printed or assembled into a PDF or DJVU file.
Scanning, optical character recognition, and assembling multi-page documents are out of scope of this project.
