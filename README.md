## About ##

Scan Tailor is an interactive post-processing tool for scanned pages. 
It performs operations such as:
  - [page splitting](https://github.com/scantailor/scantailor/wiki/Split-Pages), 
  - [deskewing](https://github.com/scantailor/scantailor/wiki/Deskew), 
  - [adding/removing borders](https://github.com/scantailor/scantailor/wiki/Page-Layout), 
  - [selecting content](https://github.com/scantailor/scantailor/wiki/Select-Content) 
  - ... and others. 
  
You give it raw scans, and you get pages ready to be printed or assembled into a PDF 
  or [DJVU](http://elpa.gnu.org/packages/djvu.html) file. Scanning, optical character recognition, 
  and assembling multi-page documents are out of scope of this project.

Scan Tailor is [Free Software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) (which is more than just freeware). 
  Itâ€™s written in C++ with Qt and released under the General Public License version 3. 
  We develop both Windows and GNU/Linux versions.

## History and Future

This project started in late 2007 and by mid 2010 it reached production quality. 

In 2014, the original developer [Joseph Artsimovich](https://github.com/Tulon) stepped aside, 
and [Nate Craun](https://natecraun.net/) ([@ncraun](https://github.com/ncraun)) 
  took over as the [new maintainer](http://scantailor.org/2014/04/06/new-maintainer.html).

    and the 3.1MB pdf is after using Scan Tailor. The OCR, Chapter Indexing, JBIG2 compression, and PDF Binding were not
